# Suggest Target Rulesets given Policy Documents

Analyze a domain's `policy_facets/computations/` per-file files and suggest 1–3 candidate target rulesets based on all their information, including section headings, summary, topic tags, and computation hints. Saves suggestion files to `specs/suggested_targets/`. The user will select one of the suggestion files as the input to `/declare-target-ruleset`.

The optional `<hint>` argument (e.g., "eligibility" or "benefit calculation") narrows what kinds of rulesets to suggest — it prioritizes candidates that match the hint phrase but still reads the whole index. When no hint is provided, all distinct policy scopes found in the index are candidates with a preference for rulesets that cover more topics.

## Input

```
/suggest-target-ruleset <domain> [<hint>]
```

Read `../../core/output-fencing.md` now.

## Pre-flight

Run these checks before doing anything else:

1. **Domain argument provided?**
   - NO → List all directories matching `$DOMAINS_DIR/*/` as a numbered menu and prompt:
     :::user_input
     Available domains:
       1. snap
       2. example_domain
     Which domain? Enter a number or domain name:
     :::
     Await the user's response and use it as `<domain>`. Then continue.

2. **Domain folder exists?**
   - NO → Print:
     :::error
     Domain not found: $DOMAINS_DIR/<domain>/
     Run: /new-domain <domain>
     :::
     Then stop.

3. **Per-file computations present?**
   - Check that `$DOMAINS_DIR/<domain>/policy_facets/computations/` exists and contains at least one `*.md.yaml` file (recursive).
   - ABSENT or empty → Print:
     :::error
     Per-file computations not found under: $DOMAINS_DIR/<domain>/policy_facets/computations/
     Run /index-inputs <domain> first, then re-run /suggest-target-ruleset <domain>.
     :::
     Then stop.

## Process

### Step 1: Analyze per-file computations

Glob every `*.md.yaml` file under `$DOMAINS_DIR/<domain>/policy_facets/computations/` **sorted lexicographically by relative path** (e.g., Python `sorted(glob(...))`) — `glob` defaults to OS-dependent order on macOS/Linux/CI, so explicit sorting is required for deterministic observation ordering downstream. Parse each as a YAML map. Read `data["sections"]` as the list of `{heading, summary, tags, computations?, variables?}` section blocks. The source path of each section is encoded in the file's relative path under `policy_facets/computations/` — strip the trailing `.yaml` to recover `<rel>.md`, then prefix with `input/policy_docs/`. (A section in `policy_facets/computations/sub/foo.md.yaml` describes `input/policy_docs/sub/foo.md`.)

Legacy on-disk files may carry a top-level `naming_manifest:` key from prior versions; this is silently ignored. The section-level `variables:` block (post-3.0) is the canonical source of per-variable verbatim phrases — read it alongside `computations:` per the aggregation rule below.

Do NOT read files under `$DOMAINS_DIR/<domain>/input/` — `policy_facets/computations/` is the sole source of doc signals.

Cluster the index signals to identify 1–5 distinct policy scopes. For each scope, derive a candidate target ruleset:

**`expr_hint:` parse rule** (uniform across consumer skills): when a computation carries `expr_hint:`, split on the first `=`; the LHS (whitespace-trimmed) is the snake_case **output name** for that computation, and the RHS is the expression. Tokenize the RHS for snake_case identifiers (skipping numeric literals, string literals, and built-in keywords like `if`, `else`, `and`, `or`, `not`, `min`, `max`, `sum`) — those identifiers are the **input names**. When `expr_hint:` is absent (descriptive-only computation), fall back to scanning `description:` prose for variable names mentioned in the source's terminology.

**Signals to extract:**
- **Topic tags** across all sections → cluster to find prominent domain areas (e.g., "income", "eligibility", "household")
- **Section headings** → reveals statutory structure and sub-program scope
- **File summaries** → reveals program scope and terminology
- **Variable inventory** → for each section's computations, apply the `expr_hint:` parse rule above to collect (output name, input names) pairs. Variables appearing only on the RHS of any `expr_hint:` (and never on an LHS) are leaf inputs; variables appearing on an LHS are computed (intermediate or final) outputs. Variables that appear on an LHS in one computation and on the RHS of another are intermediate computed variables.
- **Computation hints** → collect all `computations:` entries from sections that have the field; trace variable chains via the `expr_hint:` parse rule above (LHS-of-one is RHS-of-another → intermediate computed); collect `expr_hint:` RHS values keyed by their LHS output name; collect `preconditions:` expressions keyed by their computation's output name. Recurring precondition clauses across many entries (e.g., a large cluster of computations all gated on `"applicant is over 65"`) signal a distinct policy scope and should yield a separate candidate ruleset rather than being mixed into a more general one. If the index has no `computations:` entries, skip this signal.
- **Stage membership** → collect each section's `stage:` value (when present). Apply the same suffix-stripping normalization as `/create-ruleset-groups` (drop a trailing `_test` / `_check` / `_evaluation`). When ≥1 section has a `stage:` value, treat distinct (post-normalization) stages as **primary clustering boundaries** for candidate target rulesets — distinct stages that span large variable counts are strong signals for distinct candidate rulesets, stronger than tag/heading similarity alone. Do not merge candidates across distinct `stage:` values; stage boundaries are explicit doc signals, while tag/heading clusters are inferred. When no section has `stage:`, fall through to existing tag/heading/computation-hint clustering unchanged.

**For each candidate, derive:**
- `ruleset_name` — snake_case base filename (e.g., `eligibility_check`, `income_calculation`)
- `display_name` — human-readable title (e.g., "Determine Program Eligibility")
- `description` — one sentence describing what the ruleset computes
- `role` — AI persona for extraction (e.g., "You are a policy-to-rules analyst for eligibility determination.")
- `scope` — extraction goal sentence (e.g., "Convert the provided policy text into explicit, testable eligibility rules that produce an eligibility decision.")
- `inputs.<EntityName>.<field>` — entity-grouped input variables. See "Entity inference" below for the rule. Each `<field>` is keyed by snake_case variable name and carries optional `{type, description, observations}`.
- `computed.<field>` — flat block of computed (intermediate) variables. Variables identified as intermediate via the variable-chain analysis above (LHS-of-one, RHS-of-another) flow here. Each entry carries optional `{type, description, observations}`.
- `outputs.<field>` — flat block of output variables. Each entry carries optional `{type, description, observations}`. **List the candidate's main decision first** (the primary output); secondary outputs (denial reasons, verification flags, etc.) follow in subsequent entries. Variables that appear on an LHS but never on a downstream RHS are terminal outputs. Declaration order is load-bearing — downstream `/create-skeleton` treats the first entry as primary.

**Observation aggregation for `<field>.observations`.** For every variable that becomes an entry under `inputs.*.*`, `computed.*`, or `outputs.*`:

1. Walk every `*.md.yaml` file under `policy_facets/computations/` in the sorted iteration order from this step's opening paragraph.
2. For each section in that file, check whether the section's `variables:` block contains the variable's snake_case name as a key. (Sections that pre-date the post-3.0 `variables:` block — older files without that field — contribute no observations.)
3. When the variable is present in the block, build an observation triple `{policy_phrase, source_doc, section}` where:
   - `policy_phrase:` is the value of `variables[<name>].policy_phrase` when present; **omit** the key when the per-file entry has no `policy_phrase` (phrase-absent observation — see U1's no-fallback rule).
   - `source_doc:` is the reconstituted source path (`input/policy_docs/<rel>.md`) per the path-encoding rule above.
   - `section:` is the section's `heading:` field verbatim (including the `#` / `##` / `###` prefix).
4. Append the triple to the variable's `observations:` list. Deduplicate on the `(policy_phrase, source_doc, section)` triple — distinct triples become distinct observations; identical triples are kept once.
5. Preserve aggregate order: observations land in the order of the sorted file walk, then within a file in the order sections appear in the YAML `sections:` list.
6. When the variable appears in no section's `variables:` block (synthesized / algorithm-derived output names, or variables the AI surfaced from `description:` prose but never persisted in `variables:`), **omit `observations:` from the entry entirely** — do not emit an empty list. Downstream consumers (`/declare-target-ruleset` → naming-manifest) treat the absent field as "no source observation recorded," and `/extract-ruleset` Step 3b renders such rows with the `<seeded>` placeholder.

Multi-observation entries are normal and expected — a variable referenced across multiple policy doc sections naturally yields a multi-element list.

**Entity inference for `inputs.<EntityName>.<field>`.** Inputs are the leaf variables — those that appear on the RHS of some `expr_hint:` or in `description:` prose but never on an LHS, plus variables in descriptive-only computations that the source treats as supplied rather than computed. For each input, determine its owning entity from policy doc context. Entities are CamelCase nouns representing the conceptual owner of their fields — common examples: `Applicant`, `Household`, `Income`, `Asset`, `Resource`. Use these signals in order:

0. **Cross-source reuse pattern** (highest priority, applied before the other rules). Scan section summaries, computation descriptions, and `preconditions:` clauses for phrases that compare or reconcile two parallel sources of the same data:
   - "apply X to both A and B" / "perform X on both A and B"
   - "compare A's X with B's X" / "reconcile A and B"
   - "verify A against B" / "check A using B"
   - "X is reasonably compatible with Y" / "match A to B"
   - "use A unless B disagrees" / "A and B yield the same outcome"

   When the pattern is detected, emit **two (or more) parallel entities** sharing a mirrored field schema, one per source — do not collapse them into a single merged entity. Examples:
   - client-stated income vs. agency-verified income → `ClientStatement` + `<Agency>Record` (e.g., `DOLRecord`, `AVSRecord`, `IRSRecord`)
   - applicant-reported assets vs. third-party-reported assets → `ApplicantReport` + `ThirdPartyReport`
   - employer-reported wages vs. self-reported wages → `EmployerReport` + `SelfReport`

   Both entities carry the same field names (e.g., `ClientStatement.gross_earned_income` and `DOLRecord.gross_earned_income`); the policy's "apply X to both" language IS the explicit signal of a reusable computation module that `/create-ruleset-modules`'s `reuse_across_entities` heuristic (priority 1) will detect downstream. Collapsing them into a single `Income` entity hides this signal and prevents module detection. When Rule 0 fires, rules 1–3 below still apply to *other* inputs that don't participate in the cross-source comparison.

1. Section heading and surrounding section text for the variable's source — a variable surfaced under a "Household composition" heading likely belongs to `Household`; a variable under "Applicant demographics" likely belongs to `Applicant`.
2. The variable's source policy phrase (the verbatim noun phrase the source uses for the concept) — phrasing like "applicant's age" → `Applicant.age`; "household size" → `Household.household_size`.
3. Variable name semantics — e.g., a variable whose name starts with a clear entity prefix may indicate ownership when section context is ambiguous, but do NOT rely on prefix alone — `gross_income` is not owned by a `Gross` entity.

When the entity is unclear or ambiguous after applying the above signals, emit the field under the fallback entity `Case`. Do not invent a one-off entity per variable to avoid the fallback — `Case` exists exactly for variables that don't have a clear conceptual owner. Analysts can regroup entities during `/declare-target-ruleset` confirm.

**Type inference.** For each variable, the AI may infer a Catala-native type from policy doc context (e.g., "monthly amount" → `money`; a yes/no field → `boolean`; whole-number count → `integer`; ratio / percentage → `decimal`; "as of" date → `date`; a bulleted enumeration → `enum`; repeated values → `list`; compound record → `structure`). When inference fails, omit `type:` rather than guess — downstream consumers tolerate a missing type.

**Description.** Optional per field. Emit when there is a clear signal in the source policy text (e.g., a definition or contextual phrase). Omit when no signal exists rather than fabricate.

**When `<hint>` is provided:**
- Rank candidates by relevance to the hint phrase — prefer section headings, topic tags, and computation hints that match the hint
- Show a display header: `Suggestions focused on: <hint>`
- Still read every per-file file under `policy_facets/computations/` — the hint is a prioritization signal, not a filter that discards unrelated sections entirely
- If hint matches nothing strongly, show all candidates and note: `(No strong match found for "<hint>" — showing all candidates)`

**Display all candidates** in a numbered list:

:::detail
Suggestions focused on: <hint>            ← omit this line if no hint was provided

  1. <ruleset_name>
     <description>
     Inputs: <comma-separated entity names>
     Output: <first_output_name> (<type>)

  2. <ruleset_name>
     <description>
     Inputs: <comma-separated entity names>
     Output: <first_output_name> (<type>)

  3. <ruleset_name>   ← include only if a third distinct scope is identifiable
     ...
:::

### Step 2: Save

Save each candidate:

1. Ensure `$DOMAINS_DIR/<domain>/specs/suggested_targets/` directory exists. Create it if absent.

2. Write `$DOMAINS_DIR/<domain>/specs/suggested_targets/<ruleset_name>.yaml` using exactly this schema:

```yaml
# Auto-generated by /suggest-target-ruleset — do not edit manually
ruleset_name: <snake_case>
display_name: <string>
description: <string>
role: <string>
scope: <string>
inputs:
  <EntityName>:                 # CamelCase noun (Applicant, Household, Income, ...). Fallback: Case.
    <field_name>:               # snake_case variable name
      type: integer | decimal | money | boolean | date | duration | string | enum | list | structure  # optional; omit when no signal
      description: <string>     # optional
      observations:             # optional; multi-source phrase-level provenance per Step 1's aggregation rule. Omit entirely when no source observation recorded.
        - policy_phrase: <string>    # optional inside an observation — omit when the per-file variables: entry had no verbatim phrase
          source_doc: input/policy_docs/<rel>.md
          section: <verbatim heading including # / ## / ### prefix>
        # repeat for additional observations across sections / files
    # repeat for each field under this entity
  # repeat for each entity
computed:                       # flat — no entity grouping
  <field_name>:
    type: <type>                # optional
    description: <string>       # optional
    observations:               # optional; same shape as inputs entries
      - policy_phrase: <string>
        source_doc: input/policy_docs/<rel>.md
        section: <heading>
outputs:                        # flat — list the primary output first; declaration order is load-bearing
  <field_name>:
    type: <type>                # optional
    description: <string>       # optional
    observations:               # optional; omit on synthesized outputs that have no source observation
      - policy_phrase: <string>
        source_doc: input/policy_docs/<rel>.md
        section: <heading>
  # repeat for each output
```

   YAML conventions:
   - Two-space indentation throughout
   - All `description:` and `display_name:` values as quoted strings
   - **List the candidate's main decision as the first entry under `outputs:`** — `/create-skeleton` treats the first output as primary; secondary outputs follow
   - Omit `type:` and `description:` when no signal exists rather than guessing
   - **Omit `observations:` entirely** when the variable was never observed in any section's `variables:` block — do not emit `observations: []`. Empty list and missing key are semantically the same; the convention is to omit. Synthesized output names (e.g., a top-level `eligibility_status` not directly named in any source body) commonly land without `observations:` and surface downstream as `<seeded>` placeholders in the Name Inventory.
   - Inside an `observations:` entry, `policy_phrase:` is independently optional — omit it when the upstream `variables:` block recorded the variable without a verbatim phrase. `source_doc:` and `section:` ship together (paired-or-absent) per the merge tool's per-observation invariant.
   - Use the fallback entity `Case` for input fields with no clear conceptual owner — do not invent one-off entities to avoid the fallback
   - `# Generated:` date as YYYY-MM-DD (today's date)

3. Confirm each file written:
   :::important
   Saved: $DOMAINS_DIR/<domain>/specs/suggested_targets/<ruleset_name>.yaml
   :::

After all saves, suggest the next step:

:::next_step
Next: Run /declare-target-ruleset <domain> <ruleset_name> to create the guidance/ files from a suggestion file.
:::

---

## Output

:::important
$DOMAINS_DIR/<domain>/specs/suggested_targets/<ruleset_name>.yaml    [CREATED]
:::

(one line per saved file)

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Do not include `intermediate_variables`, `constraints`, `standards`, `guidance`, `edge_cases`, `skeleton:`, `ruleset_groups:`, or `ruleset_modules:` in suggestion files** — those are written by later skills (`/create-skeleton`, `/create-ruleset-groups`, `/create-ruleset-modules`)
- **Do not read files under `$DOMAINS_DIR/<domain>/input/`** — `policy_facets/computations/` is the sole source of doc signals
- **Do not suggest a single monolithic ruleset when the index shows multiple distinct policy scopes** — identify separate scopes as separate candidates (e.g., an income exclusion chain and an eligibility determination are two distinct scopes)
- **Do not emit a `primary:` flag on `outputs.<field>` entries** — primary distinction is encoded by declaration order (first entry = primary); `/create-skeleton` reads that order when writing `guidance/output-variables.yaml`. Emitting `primary:` adds noise that downstream tooling strips.
- **Do not guess `type:` when no signal exists** — omit the field instead. Same for `description:`.
- **Do not fabricate `observations:` entries** — only emit observations for variables that appear in a per-file YAML's section-level `variables:` block. The block is the canonical source of phrase-level provenance; do not synthesize observations from headings, descriptions, or expr_hint tokens alone.
- **Do not emit `observations: []`** — when a variable has no source observation (synthesized output, or never persisted in any `variables:` block), omit the `observations:` key entirely. Empty list and missing key are semantically equivalent; the convention is to omit.
- **Do not glob without sorting** — `policy_facets/computations/**/*.md.yaml` iteration order must be lexicographic by relative path (use `sorted(glob(...))` in Python). OS-dependent file ordering produces non-deterministic observation order across macOS / Linux / CI, which propagates into the manifest and surfaces as spurious diffs across re-runs.
- **Do not invent a one-off entity per variable to avoid the `Case` fallback** — `Case` is the correct entity for input fields with no clear conceptual owner. Splintering into `Misc1`, `Misc2`, etc. is worse than using `Case`.
- **Do not collapse parallel data sources into a single entity** — when policy text says "apply X to both A and B", or compares A against B (reasonable compatibility, AVS-vs-client, employer-vs-self, etc.), emit two parallel entities (e.g., `ClientStatement` + `DOLRecord`), not one merged `Income` or `Data` entity. Merging hides the reuse signal that `/create-ruleset-modules`'s `reuse_across_entities` heuristic needs to detect a shared sub-module. This is Entity Inference Rule 0 — the highest-priority rule, applied before heading/policy-phrase/name signals.
- **Do not group computed variables under entities** — `computed:` is flat. Computed values are functions of multiple entities' inputs; they don't conceptually belong to one entity.
- **Do not use block-style lists for `type:` values** — `type: enum` not `type:\n  - approve\n  - deny`
- **Do not guess domain names or paths** — always expand `$DOMAINS_DIR` from `.xlator.local.env` if the variable is unknown
- **When hint matches nothing strongly, show all candidates** — do not suppress candidates because they don't match the hint; the hint is a ranking signal only
- **Do not merge candidates across distinct `stage:` values** — `stage:` is an explicit doc signal; merging two stage-tagged scopes into one candidate ruleset discards information the analyst already encoded in the source
- **Do not write `stage:` or modify it** — `stage:` is single-owner; only `/extract-computations` writes the field. This skill reads it
